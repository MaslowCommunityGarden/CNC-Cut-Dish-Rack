I coated my dish rack with three coats of [polyurithane](http://www.minwax.com/wood-products/clear-protective-finishes/interior/minwax-fastdrying-polyurethane).

Once the polyurithane had dried I screwed the parts together using 1.5 inch long screws. Four screws through the top of the dish rack attach the arms, and four screws through the sides of the arms attach the basket which holds the spoons. Pre-drilling these holes before putting the screws in is a good idea.

I then gave it one final coat of polyurithane to protect the spaces between the parts.
