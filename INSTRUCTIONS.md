I coated my dish rack with three coats of [polyurithane](http://www.minwax.com/wood-products/clear-protective-finishes/interior/minwax-fastdrying-polyurethane).

Once the polyurithane had dried I screwed the parts together using 1.5 inch long screws. 

I then gave it one final coat of polyurithane to protect the spaces between the parts.
