# CNC Cut Dish Rack
A CNC cut over-sink dish rack



I read [this 99% invisible article](https://99percentinvisible.org/article/finnish-dishes-simple-nordic-design-beats-dishwashers-drying-racks/) about Finnish dish drying cabnets which let you keep your dishes directly over the sink so that instead of draining into a dish rack (which is invariably gross), they drain directly into the sink.

I wanted one, but I live in an appartment and I can't install a cabnet so I made a shelf version. I've had mine for several months now, and I love it.

You can find the open source CAD files here, along with the generated gcode if you just want to cut right away.

The original OnShape CAD document is also open source and available free here:
